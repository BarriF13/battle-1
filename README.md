### Battle
=========================
 
###### The idea
With a basic understanding of HTTP, response-request mechanisms, Sinatra, and Capybara, this is a project that uses these technologies.

###### Battle capabilities:

As two Players ee want to
- [x] Start a fight by entering our Names and seeing them
- [x] Switch turns

As Player 1:
- [x] I want to see Player 2's Hit Points
- [x] I want to attack Player 2, and I want to get a confirmation
- [x] I want my attack to reduce Player 2's hit points by 10
- [x] I want to see my own hit points
- [x] I want Player 2 to attack me, and I want to get a confirmation
- [x] I want Player 2's attack to reduce my HP by 10
- [ ] I want to see a 'Lose' message if I reach 0HP first

###### Built with

Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS

###### How to run
[never-ending-battle.herokuapp.com](https://never-ending-battle.herokuapp.com/)

###### Testing
* Feature/browser testing with Capybara: `rackup`
* Unit testing with Rspec : `rspec`

###### notes
This was week 3 @ Makers Academy: <br>
Goal: to set up a web project with testing frameworks
* The project is unfortunately unfinished as we got to the end of the week; the last user story is not implemented, so the game never ends!<br>
<br>_I will revisit this in time._
