### Battle
=========================
 
###### The idea
Now that we have a basic understanding of HTTP, response-request mechanisms, Sinatra, and Capybara we are going to construct a project that uses these technologies.

###### Battle capabilities:

As two Players
- [ ] We want to Start a fight by entering our Names and seeing them
- [ ] As two Players, We want to switch turns

As Player 1:
- [ ] I want to see Player 2's Hit Points
- [ ] I want to attack Player 2, and I want to get a confirmation
- [ ] I want my attack to reduce Player 2's HP by 10
- [ ] I want to see my own hit points
- [ ] I want Player 2 to attack me, and I want to get a confirmation
- [ ] I want Player 2's attack to reduce my HP by 10
- [ ] I want to see a 'Lose' message if I reach 0HP first
